<h1>
First Steps in Formatting
</h1>

<p>
The formatting of words has always been an integral part of the writing/ reading process: think about hand-written medieval manuscripts with their beautiful illuminated texts, or consider the design of the inside pages of contemporary novels or, indeed, of your essays and dissertations (page size, title page, contents, bibliography, font size, punctuation ...). We have become so familiar with certain print conventions that the medium has become largely transparent or, when it does assert itself we tend to 'feel' it as a sensual artifact ("I like taking books to bed").
</p>

<p>
A new medium such as the web demands self-conscious attention to the format of its text, and millions of words (print and online) are dedicated to the topic of 'web design'. More precisely, within the genre of web-specific fiction, formatting techniques are used to generate literary/ artistic meaning, and explicit attention to formatting is the first characteristic of web writing.

This lesson will teach you simple formatting:<br>
how to change the colo(u)r of the font and background, how to apply font emphasis such as bold or italic, how to change the size of your font, and how to position text on the page.
</p>

<h2>
BODY COLO(U)R
</h2>

<p>
To change the body colo(u)r you need to add the attribute to the   < BODY > tag, like this:
<br>
< BODY BGCOLOR="black" >
</p>

<h2>
FONT ATTRIBUTES
</h2>

<p>You can specify the font colour by using the BODY tag:
<br>
< BODY BGCOLOR="black" TEXT="green" >
<br>
Or you can stipulate the attributes of different chunks of text throughout the body of the page.<br>
This involves a new tag, the < FONT > tag and its partner < /FONT>.
<br>
You type the font tag at the beginning and end of your text to change features such as colour and size. For example:
</p>

<p>
< FONT COLOR="red" SIZE="4" > This is quite bold and bright < /FONT >
You can use numbers 1-7 inclusive.
<br><br>
< B > bold < /B >
<br><br>
< I > italic < /I >
<br>br>
< U > underline < /U >
<br><br>
< H > Heading tags can be used from a large < H1> down to a very small font < H6 >, and tags must always be closed.<br>
For example:
</p>

<h1>
< H1 > BIG HEADING < /H1 >
</h1>

<p>
Try the out the other sizes, and note the space above and below the typed line.
